    <h4>A study on technological solutions for the analysis and classification
        of
        human activities based on M2M communication systems and models</h4>

        Mist Computing is an architectural paradigm in which some of the operations of an IoT network are moved towards
        the
        nodes on its edge, in order to fully utilize their increase in computational power and to analyze the type of
        advantages
        under this structure. This work is a study aimed at implementing this type of paradigm in an indoor setting, in
        order to
        gather information about the activities related to the environment; this information can be used to give orders
        to
        different actuators nodes.

        Several application protocols have been analyzed, assessing their positive and negative
        aspects and taking into account the mostly used standards in the community. By creating an environment in which
        there is
        a bond between video and audio data, smart devices are bound to everyday events. This allows to obtain
        information
        on
        everyday habits and collect them in statistics in order to build activity schemes for the actuators.
    </p>

    <p>
        Some
        architectural
        schemes have been proposed for the modeling and implementation of the chosen paradigm nodes, putting them in the
        general
        contest of Internet of Things and comparing them with other common paradigms used. The study also focuses on a
        particular kind of node, that acquires and analyzes audio data; these pieces of information obtained through the
        node
        play a pivotal role in the project and mark the starting point for the analysis of the context taken into
        consideration.
        The strength of this approach lies on the possibility of using this type of application with remote data
        analysis
        services, capable of constructing recurrent behavioral schemes to be matched to related activity schemes for the
        actuators. â€‹
